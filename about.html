            ðŸš€ As a creative and purposeful individual with an unwavering passion for programming, my journey in the
            world of technology is fueled by the belief that challenges are opportunities to excel. With a "Give me a
            task and I will solve it" mantra as my slogan, I fearlessly navigate through complexities, utilizing my
            programming experience as a foundation for continuous growth.<br/><br/>

            ðŸ’¡ Every day is an exploration, a chance to learn and experiment with new things. Being a fervent
            advocate of continuous improvement, delving into books, courses and various projects to broaden my skill
            set. I see programming not just as a profession but as a canvas for innovation and problem-solving.<br/><br/>

            ðŸŒŸ With a deep love for humanity, I approach coding not only as a technical craft but as a means to make a
            positive impact on people's lives.

          <h3>Tallinn University</h3>
          <h6>BA Informatics</h6>
          <p>In my Informatics studies at the university, I've immersed myself in a dynamic array of subjects. From crafting user-friendly interfaces and designing software architecture to mastering algorithms and data structures, I've covered a broad spectrum.<br/>

            I explored the Internet of Things using platforms like Arduino and NodeMCU, worked with various sensors, and dabbled in different programming languages. Artificial intelligence, game development principles, and 3D modeling became familiar territories.<br/>

            My academic journey also included cybersecurity, computer networks, data communication, and mobile application development. I delved into the legal aspects of intellectual property and data protection.<br/>

            From understanding operating systems to practical applications, I've gained a holistic perspective on technology. My studies have not only equipped me with a versatile skill set but also instilled a deep appreciation for the interconnected nature of the Informatics field.<br/>

            In software engineering, I specialize in creating visually appealing and user-friendly front-end interfaces using various frameworks. On the backend, my focus is on developing efficient APIs that adhere to the principle of orthogonality, allowing for the creation of interchangeable components. This approach ensures the flexibility to replace components seamlessly without disrupting the application's functionality.</p>
